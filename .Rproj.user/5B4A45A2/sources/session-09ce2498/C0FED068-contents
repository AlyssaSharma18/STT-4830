# Question 1.19
Part a:

The least squares estimate of $\beta_1$ is 0.03883 according to the summary function. The least squares estimate of $\beta_0$ is  2.11405 according to the summary function.

The estimated regression function is $\hat{Y_i} = 2.11405 + 0.03883(X_i) + \epsilon$

```{r cars}
adf <- read.table("http://www.cnachtsheim-text.csom.umn.edu/Kutner/Chapter%20%201%20Data%20Sets/CH01PR19.txt")

head(adf)

colnames(adf) <- c("gpa","act")

a_LS_model <- lm(gpa ~ act, data = adf)
summary_a_LS_model <- summary(a_LS_model)
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
summary_a_LS_model
```


Part b:

The estimated regression function does not seem to fit the data well.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(adf, aes(x = act, y = gpa)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "act", y = "gpa", title = "1.19 example scatter plot") +
  theme_bw()
```

Part c:

The point estimate of GPA when the ACT test score is 30 is $\hat{Y_{12}} = 3.279$.
```{r}
library(moderndive)
Fittedandresiduals <-get_regression_points(a_LS_model)
Fittedandresiduals

#Method 2
#Simply use the summary_toluca_LS_model object to get residuals and fitted values

#Here is 1.23:
sumris <- sum(Fittedandresiduals$residual)
sse <- sum((Fittedandresiduals$residual)^2)
sumris
sse

#part b
mse <- sse/(nrow(adf) - 2)
mse
sqrt(mse)
  
```
Part d:
The point estimate of the change in the mean response when the entrance test score increases by one point is $\beta_1$, which is equal to 0.03883. 

# Question 1.20
Part a:

The estimated regression function is $\hat{Y_i} = 0.254192 + 0.063683(X_i) + \epsilon$

Here is the code for 1.20:

```{r}
copyvstime <- read.table("http://www.cnachtsheim-text.csom.umn.edu/Kutner/Chapter%20%201%20Data%20Sets/CH01PR20.txt", sep ="" , header = FALSE)

head(copyvstime)

colnames(copyvstime) <- c("copy","time1")

ct_LS_model <- lm(time1 ~ copy, data = copyvstime)
summary_ct_LS_model <- summary(ct_LS_model)
summary_ct_LS_model
```

Part b:

The estimated regression function fits the data very well. The residuals are quite small as compared to the previous problem. There is a strong positive correlation in both the estimated regression function and in the original data.
```{r}
ggplot(copyvstime, aes(x = copy, y = time1)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = " number of copiers serviced", y = "total number of minutes spent by the service person", title = "1.20 example, LS line added") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

Part c:
$\beta_0$ has no meaning in this problem. If 0 copiers are serviced, then in the real world, the number of minutes spent servicing is also going to be 0, not 0.254192.

Part d:
The point estimate of the mean service time when 5 copiers are serviced is 0.572607. This number is calculated below. 

```{r}
library(moderndive)
Fittedandresiduals <-get_regression_points(ct_LS_model)
Fittedandresiduals

a <- .254192 + (.063683*5)
a



```
# Question 1.23

Part a:
The residuals sum to -0.005, which is approximately 0. This number may have been produced due to a floating point error. 
Part b: 
The estimate of $\sigma^2$ is 0.3883074. The estimate of $\sigma$ is 0.6231431.
```{r}
library(moderndive)
Fittedandresiduals <-get_regression_points(a_LS_model)
Fittedandresiduals

#Method 2
#Simply use the summary_toluca_LS_model object to get residuals and fitted values

#Here is 1.23:
sumris <- sum(Fittedandresiduals$residual)
sse <- sum((Fittedandresiduals$residual)^2)
sumris
sse

#part b
mse <- sse/(nrow(adf) - 2)
mse
sqrt(mse)
```


# Question 1.24

Part a:

The residuals $e_i$ are computed with the get_regression_points formula below. The sum of the residuals $\Sigma{e_i}$ is -0.002 which is approximately zero. The sum of the squared residuals $\Sigma{e_i}^2$ is 14.47071. The sum of squared residuals is much larger than the sum of the residuals.


Part b: 
The estimate of $\sigma^2$ is 0.3365282. The estimate of $\sigma$ is 0.5801105. These values are expressed in minutes serviced and squared minutes serviced.



```{r}
#here is the problem 1.24 code
library(moderndive)
Fittedandresiduals <-get_regression_points(ct_LS_model)
Fittedandresiduals

#a <- .254192 + (.063683*5)
#a

sumris <- sum(Fittedandresiduals$residual)
sumris
sumrissq <-  sum((Fittedandresiduals$residual)^2)
sumrissq
b <- sumrissq/(nrow(copyvstime) - 2)
b
sqrt(b)
```
